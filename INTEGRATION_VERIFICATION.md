## Database Configuration

### Supabase Integration

- **Status:** Configured
- **Requirements:**
  - Supabase project setup with proper schema
  - Environment variables for Supabase connection
  - Role-based security policies

### Required Environment Variables

For the application to function correctly with the database, the following environment variables must be set:

#### Backend

```
# Supabase Connection
SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your-supabase-service-role-key>

# OR for direct PostgreSQL connection
DB_HOST=<database-host>
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=<database-name>
DB_USER=<database-username>
DB_PASSWORD=<database-password>
```

#### Frontend

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<backend-api-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=<websocket-url>
```

## Testing Results

All components have been successfully tested for proper integration with the backend:

1. **Authentication:** Users can register, login, and access protected routes
2. **Content:** Creating, editing, and managing content works with the backend
3. **Search:** Text and semantic search return relevant results
4. **Notifications:** Real-time notifications appear when triggered
5. **Tools:** Tool directory displays data from the backend with filtering
6. **Reputation:** Reputation and badges display correctly for users

## Pending Items
