      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Project Setup and Configuration task into subtasks covering repository initialization, directory structure setup, environment configuration, dependency installation, and documentation creation.",
      "reasoning": "Medium-low complexity as it involves standard setup procedures with clear acceptance criteria. The task requires technical knowledge but follows established patterns with no complex integrations or performance requirements."

      "taskTitle": "Database Schema Design",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Database Schema Design task into subtasks for each core entity (users, content, tags, tools, reviews), plus migration implementation, seed data creation, and vector search configuration.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to the need to design multiple interconnected entities, implement migrations, seed data, and configure vector search capabilities. This requires deep database knowledge and careful planning to ensure all relationships are properly modeled."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the User Authentication System into subtasks covering registration, login, OAuth integration, email verification, profile setup, performance optimization, and edge case handling.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to integration with external services (Auth0/Cognito), multiple authentication flows, strict performance requirements (<300ms), and numerous edge cases to handle. Security implications add additional complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Content Creation & Editing",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Content Creation & Editing task into subtasks for rich-text editor implementation, code block functionality, image upload system, version history tracking, autosave mechanism, rollback functionality, and integration testing.",
      "reasoning": "Very high complexity due to rich-text editing, code blocks with syntax highlighting, image management, version history, and autosave functionality. Each component has its own technical challenges and they must work together seamlessly."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Search Functionality into subtasks for vector search implementation, lexical fallback mechanism, performance optimization, filter integration, edge case handling, relevance tuning, and load testing.",
      "reasoning": "Very high complexity due to vector search implementation with pgvector, lexical fallback, strict latency requirements (â‰¤700ms), and the need to handle various edge cases. Requires specialized knowledge in search algorithms and performance optimization."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Reputation System into subtasks for upvote/acceptance mechanisms, reputation calculation, badge implementation, privilege tier system, reputation history tracking, and real-time updates.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to the need to implement multiple interconnected features (upvotes, accepted answers, badges) and a tiered privilege system. Real-time updates and accurate tracking add additional complexity."
