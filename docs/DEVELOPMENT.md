# Development Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the development standards, practices, and workflows for the community.io platform. All contributors should follow these guidelines to ensure consistent, high-quality code.

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- PostgreSQL (v14 or later) with pgvector extension
- Docker and Docker Compose (for local development)
- Git

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/communityio/platform.git
   cd platform
   ```

2. Copy the environment configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Edit the `.env` file with your local configuration and API keys.

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

6. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

7. Seed the database with sample data (optional):
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

8. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Task Management

We use the task-master CLI for managing development tasks:

1. View current tasks:
   ```bash
   task-master list
   ```

2. Start working on a task:
   ```bash
   task-master set-status --id=<task-id> --status=in-progress
   ```

3. Break down complex tasks:
   ```bash
   task-master expand --id=<task-id>
   ```

4. Mark tasks as complete:
   ```bash
   task-master set-status --id=<task-id> --status=done
   ```

### Git Workflow

1. Create a new branch for each task:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/task-<id>-<brief-description>
   ```

2. Make small, focused commits with clear messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "[TASK-<id>] Brief description of changes"
   ```

3. Push your branch to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/task-<id>-<brief-description>
   ```

4. Create a pull request when the task is complete.

5. Ensure all CI checks pass before merging.

## Code Standards

### General Guidelines

- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Add comments for complex logic, but prefer readable code over excessive comments
- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes

### JavaScript/TypeScript Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Use async/await instead of Promises where possible
- Use ES6+ features appropriately
- Avoid any usage of `any` type in TypeScript

### React Standards

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use React Context for state that needs to be shared across components
- Follow the container/presentational component pattern
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling

### API Standards

- Follow RESTful principles for API design
- Use consistent naming conventions for endpoints
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Document all endpoints with JSDoc comments
- Validate all input data

### Database Standards

- Use migrations for all database changes
- Write efficient queries that minimize database load
- Include appropriate indexes for frequently queried fields
- Use transactions for operations that modify multiple tables
- Follow naming conventions for tables, columns, and constraints

## Testing

### Unit Testing

- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Use Jest as the testing framework
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high test coverage of critical paths

### Integration Testing

- Test API endpoints with real database interactions
- Verify correct behavior of integrated components
- Use a separate test database for integration tests

### End-to-End Testing

- Test critical user flows with Cypress
- Include tests for different screen sizes
- Test with realistic user scenarios

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests only
npm run test:integration

# Run e2e tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document all public functions, classes, and interfaces
- Use JSDoc format for JavaScript/TypeScript documentation
- Include examples for complex functions
- Document expected inputs and outputs

### API Documentation

- Keep the API.md file updated with all endpoints
- Include request and response examples
- Document authentication requirements
- List possible error responses

### Architecture Documentation

- Update ARCHITECTURE.md when making significant changes
- Document design decisions and their rationale
- Include diagrams for complex systems

## Deployment

### Staging Deployment

Staging deployments happen automatically when changes are merged to the `develop` branch:

1. CI/CD pipeline builds and tests the application
2. Application is deployed to the staging environment
3. Automated smoke tests verify basic functionality
4. Manual testing can be performed on the staging environment

### Production Deployment

Production deployments happen after approval of a release PR to the `main` branch:

1. Create a release PR from `develop` to `main`
2. CI/CD pipeline builds and tests the application
3. Manual approval is required for deployment
4. Application is deployed to production with zero-downtime strategy
5. Post-deployment verification tests are run

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize bundle size with code splitting
- Use lazy loading for components not needed on initial render
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Optimize database queries for performance
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Implement efficient search algorithms

## Security Best Practices

- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies updated to avoid security vulnerabilities
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Store sensitive data securely (passwords, API keys, etc.)

## Accessibility

- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide alternative text for images
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
- Test with screen readers
- Maintain sufficient color contrast
- Support text resizing

## Internationalization (i18n)

- Use a translation framework for all user-facing text
- Avoid hardcoding strings
- Support right-to-left languages
- Format dates, numbers, and currencies according to locale
- Test with different languages and locales

## Monitoring and Debugging

- Implement comprehensive logging
- Use structured log formats
- Set up alerts for critical errors
- Monitor performance metrics
- Use distributed tracing for complex requests
- Implement user analytics to track feature usage
