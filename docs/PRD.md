## Goals and Objectives

**G1 – Unified Hub**: Achieve 100k registered members within 12 months by consolidating AI discourse and resources.

**G2 – High-Quality Knowledge Exchange**: Reach ≥85% accepted-answer rate on Q&A threads and ≥4.5/5 average content rating.

**G3 – Sustainable Revenue**: Generate ≥US$1M ARR by month 18 through tiered memberships, sponsorships, and enterprise offerings.

## Success Metrics

- MAU / Total Users ≥30% by month 6.
- 90-day retention ≥40% across cohorts.
- Content creator ratio ≥10% of monthly active users.
- Free→Paid conversion ≥25% by month 18.
