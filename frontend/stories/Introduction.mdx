# Community Platform Design System

Welcome to the Community Platform design system documentation. This Storybook serves as both an interactive playground and a living documentation for our UI components and design tokens.

## Getting Started

Use the navigation sidebar to explore the various components in our design system. Each component page includes:

- Interactive examples
- Props documentation
- Different variants and states
- Code snippets for usage

## Design Principles

Our design system is built on the following principles:

### Systematic
Use a consistent design language and reusable components for a coherent experience.

### Accessible
Design for all users, regardless of ability or situation.

### Responsive
Create interfaces that work across all device sizes and platforms.

### Delightful
Add thoughtful animations and micro-interactions that enhance the experience.

## Design Token Structure

Our design tokens are structured in a semantic way to provide meaning and context:

- **Surface Colors**: For backgrounds and containers
- **Content Colors**: For text and icons
- **Brand Colors**: For branded elements
- **Semantic Colors**: For status and feedback
- **Accent Colors**: For UI emphasis

## Component Categories

The design system is organized into several categories:

### Foundation
- Color System
- Typography
- Spacing
- Border Radius
- Shadows

### Layout
- ResponsiveContainer
- ResponsiveLayout
- ResponsiveGrid

### Form Components
- Button

### UI Elements
- Card
- Badge
- Avatar
- Dialog
- FloatingActionButton
- SpeedDial

### Feedback Components
- Skeleton
- Spinner
- Toast
- LoadingPage

## Usage

To use components from this design system in your code:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card, CardHeader, CardContent, CardFooter } from "@/components/ui/card";

// Example usage
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>My Card Title</CardHeader>
      <CardContent>Card content goes here</CardContent>
      <CardFooter>
        <Button>Action</Button>
      </CardFooter>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

## Theme Toggle

Use the theme toggle in the Storybook toolbar to switch between light and dark mode to see how components adapt to different color schemes.
