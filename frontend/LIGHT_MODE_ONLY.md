# Light Mode Configuration

This project has been configured to use light mode only, as requested.

## Changes Made

1. **ThemeProvider Configuration**:
   - Updated `ClientLayout.tsx` to force light theme with `forcedTheme="light"` prop
   - Removed `enableSystem` property to prevent system preferences from overriding
   - Set `defaultTheme="light"` for initial load state

2. **Theme Toggle Component**:
   - Modified `LumenThemeToggle.tsx` to return `null` (doesn't render)
   - Fixed syntax error in the component (removed unnecessary brackets)

3. **CSS Updates**:
   - Changed class names from `.light-theme` to `.light` in globals.css and lumen-colors.css
   - Improved contrast of muted foreground text to meet accessibility standards
   - Added commredesign-components.css import to enhance light mode

4. **Component Updates**:
   - Updated `Header.tsx` to use light Glass variant instead of dark
   - Updated `Footer.tsx` to use light Glass variant for consistency
   - Updated messaging to reflect light mode focus in footer text

## Next Steps

While the site now forces light mode, there are still some selectors and styles in the codebase that contain `.dark` classes. These are harmless since the `.dark` class will never be applied to the HTML element, but for code cleanliness you may want to remove these in a future cleanup pass.

For complete UI consistency, additional changes to consider:
1. Remove all remaining dark mode styles from component CSS files
2. Update glass components to have better light mode appearance
3. Ensure all colors have sufficient contrast for accessibility
4. Fine-tune shadows and borders for a cohesive light appearance

## How to Test

Visit the site to confirm it renders in light mode:
- Header should have a light glass effect instead of dark
- Footer should be light-themed with improved readability
- Text throughout the site should have proper contrast
- All UI elements should be clearly visible on light backgrounds
