## Next Steps

The primary focus should be on completing the frontend implementation for the in-progress tasks. The backend implementation is largely complete across all tasks, but the frontend is lagging behind in several key areas:

1. Connect the content editor to the backend API
2. Implement search results UI connected to the search API
3. Create reputation and badge UI components
4. Connect notification UI to real-time WebSocket service
5. Connect tool directory to backend API with real data

Since the backend is well-developed, most remaining work is in the frontend implementation and integration with the existing backend services.
