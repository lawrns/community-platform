## Timeline

Estimated completion time: **10 working days**

| Day | Tasks |
|-----|-------|
| 1-2 | Complete Content Creation & Editing integration |
| 3-4 | Finish Search Functionality integration |
| 5-6 | Complete Notification Engine integration |
| 7-8 | Implement Tool Directory integration |
| 9-10 | Implement Reputation System integration and final testing |

## Resources and Dependencies

- All required API services are already defined in `/frontend/lib/api.ts`
- UI components for most features are available in the component library
- Backend API endpoints appear to be ready for integration
- WebSocket functionality needs backend support for real-time notifications

## Conclusion

The frontend integration is approximately 60% complete overall. With focused effort on the remaining tasks, full integration can be achieved within 10 working days. The priority order ensures that the most critical functionality is implemented first, allowing for an incremental release approach if needed.
