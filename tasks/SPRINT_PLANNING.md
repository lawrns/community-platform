## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Component Structure**
   - Use existing component structure when possible
   - Create new components only when necessary for reusability
   - Follow project's component design patterns

2. **API Integration**
   - Use the API service layer in `/frontend/lib/api.ts`
   - Implement proper error handling for all API calls
   - Add loading states for all async operations

3. **State Management**
   - Use React hooks for component state
   - Implement optimistic UI updates where appropriate
   - Handle edge cases (empty states, errors, loading)

4. **Testing Approach**
   - Write unit tests for new service functions
   - Create component tests for UI behavior
   - Perform manual testing of integrated components

## Definition of Done

A user story is considered complete when:

1. The feature is implemented according to specifications
2. The UI is connected to the backend API
3. Loading, error, and empty states are handled
4. Unit tests are written and passing
5. The implementation has been code reviewed
6. The feature works in different browsers and screen sizes

## Risk Assessment

- **API Compatibility**: Some backend APIs may need adjustments for frontend needs
- **Performance**: Real data may impact UI performance compared to mock data
- **Authentication**: Ensuring proper auth token handling for all API calls
- **WebSocket Reliability**: Real-time notifications depend on stable WebSocket connections

## Post-Sprint Goals

After completing the frontend-backend integration, the next priorities will be:

1. Comprehensive end-to-end testing
2. Performance optimization
3. UI polish and consistency
4. Accessibility improvements
5. Documentation updates
