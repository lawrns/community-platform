# Task ID: SEC-101
# Title: Enforce CSP & tighten CORS to allowed origins
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: AUTH-001, PIPE-003
# Priority: P1
# Estimate: 1 day
# Assignee: @security-team
# Type: High-Impact

## Description
Enhance security by enforcing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers and restricting CORS to allowed origins only.

## Details
1. Implement strict Content Security Policy headers
2. Configure CORS to only allow access from trusted domains
3. Test all cross-origin requests to ensure they work as expected
4. Document security configuration changes

## Test Strategy
1. Verify CSP headers are properly set on all responses
2. Test CORS with valid and invalid origin requests
3. Ensure frontend integrations continue to work with new security policies
4. Run security scan to verify improvements

## Acceptance Criteria
- Strict CSP headers in place for all responses
- CORS only allows requests from authorized domains
- All legitimate cross-origin functionality works correctly
- Security scan shows no CSP or CORS vulnerabilities
- Documentation updated with security configuration details
