## Description
Fix intermittent Postgres connection timeouts that are affecting database reliability.

## Details
1. Investigate the root cause of connection timeouts
2. Check connection pool configuration and settings
3. Implement proper connection retry and error handling logic
4. Add monitoring for connection health

## Test Strategy
1. Set up stress test to simulate high connection load
2. Monitor connection pool behavior under load
3. Verify stability after implementing fixes
4. Run full test suite to ensure no regressions

## Acceptance Criteria
- No database connection timeouts under normal load
- Proper error handling for exceptional cases
- Connection pool properly configured for the application's needs
- Monitoring in place to alert on any future connection issues
