# Task 5: Taxonomy & Tagging System (FEAT-003)

**Status:** Done  
**Dependencies:** 2  
**Priority:** P0  

## Description
Implement taxonomy and tagging system (FEAT-003)

## Details
Implement hierarchical topics and free-form tags. Add tag suggestion for typos and limit to 5 tags per post.

## Implementation Summary

### Hierarchical Topics
- Implemented `TopicRepository` with full hierarchy support
- Created `topicHierarchyService` for managing hierarchical topics
- Supported parent-child relationships with unlimited depth
- Added breadcrumb generation for navigation
- Implemented API endpoints for all topic operations

### Free-form Tags
- Implemented `TagRepository` for tag management
- Added tag suggestion for typos using PostgreSQL trigram similarity
- Created tag endpoints for searching, filtering, and suggesting tags
- Implemented 5-tag limit per post via database constraint
- Added validation and normalization through `tagSuggestionService`

### Testing
- Added unit tests for all services
- Created API endpoint tests to verify functionality
- Added validation script `validate-taxonomy.js` to check implementation against requirements

### Database Migrations
- Created migration `03_tag_similarity.js` to add trigram similarity extension
- Added database functions and triggers for tag limits and suggestions

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Hierarchical topics are implemented correctly
- [x] Free-form tags can be added to content
- [x] System suggests existing tags for typos
- [x] Maximum of 5 tags per post is enforced
- [x] Tags are searchable and filterable

## Key Files
- `/src/routes/api/tags/index.ts`: Tag API endpoints
- `/src/routes/api/topics/index.ts`: Topic API endpoints
- `/src/services/tags/tagSuggestionService.ts`: Tag suggestion and validation
- `/src/services/topics/topicHierarchyService.ts`: Topic hierarchy management
- `/src/models/TagRepository.ts`: Tag database operations
- `/src/models/TopicRepository.ts`: Topic database operations
- `/migrations/03_tag_similarity.js`: Database migrations for tag similarity
- `/scripts/validate-taxonomy.js`: Validation script

## Notes
- The topic hierarchy implementation allows for unlimited depth, but excessive depth may impact performance
- Tag suggestions use PostgreSQL's trigram similarity with a threshold of 0.3 (configurable)
- The 5-tag limit is enforced at both database and service layers for robustness
