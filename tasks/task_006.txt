# Task ID: 6
# Title: Search Functionality
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: P0
# Description: Implement keyword and semantic search (FEAT-004)
# Details:
Implement vector search using pgvector with lexical fallback. Ensure latency is â‰¤700ms for 95th percentile.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test search functionality with various query types
2. Measure search latency under different loads
3. Verify lexical fallback when vector search isn't available
4. Test filtering by content type, tags, and other metadata

# Implementation Notes:
1. Backend implementation is complete with both vector and lexical search
2. PostgreSQL pgvector extension configured and working
3. Search API endpoints implemented and functional
4. Frontend search page exists but not connected to the backend
5. Search results display and filtering UI needs implementation

# Remaining Work:
1. Connect frontend search component to backend API
2. Implement search results display with proper formatting
3. Add filter functionality for search results
4. Optimize search performance for latency requirements
5. Implement search analytics to improve results over time
